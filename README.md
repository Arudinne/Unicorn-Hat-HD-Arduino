# Unicorn-Hat-HD-Arduino

The goal of this library is to allow the Unicorn Hat HD to be controlled as if it were a 16x16 of NeoPixel or DotStar LEDs (or as if were a 256 LED strand).

Pixel 0 is in the top right corner below the Unicorn Hat HD silkscreen. Pixel 255 is in the bottom left corner. 

Tested on an Adafruit Feather NRF52, but should work on most Arduino Compatible devices.
