# Unicorn-Hat-HD-Arduino

First example Code to test the Pimoroni Unicorn Hat HD with an Arduino.

The goal of this code is to eventually create a library that will allow the Unicorn Hat HD to be controlled as if it were a 16x16 array of NeoPixel or DotStar LEDs (more or less).

Currently it displays the same test pattern as the Adafruit DotStar strand test.

Pixel 0 is in the top right corner. Pixel 255 is in the bottom left corner.

Tested on an Adafruit Feather NRF52, but should work on most Arduino Compatible devices.
